# Introduction

Welcome to the Verify Payments API ðŸ‘‹! The reference documentation below describes the various functions that you can use to initiate, track and manage fiat transfer using the Verify Payments API.

<aside class="notice">
This API is currently in beta. We may push breaking changes to the API endpoints on short notice. Make sure to <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.verify.as/forum/#!forum/api-announcements" target="_blank" data-link="_">join our mailing list</a> to get notified of such changes ahead of time.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.stgverifypayments.com/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token %test_secret_key%"
```

> The code above actually works. You can paste it directly in your terminal to try it out!

You can authenticate requests to the Verify Payments API by including your public key or secret key in the request that you send, depending on the endpoint. Each endpoint will indicate which key it expects from you. We currently use [Token authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) without the underlying OAuth 2.0 protocol.

<aside class=notice>
<strong>Heads up</strong> &mdash; Never use your <strong>secret key</strong> in any public environments including client-side web apps or mobile applications. It should only be used in direct server-to-server calls.
</aside>

The private keys used to authenticate with the API are generated through the Dashboard &mdash; keep these private! Make sure not to commit them to your source code repositories or share them.

Include the API key for all requests to the server in a header that looks like the following: `Authorization: Token "%test_secret_key%"`

All API calls must be made using [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over unsecured HTTP connections will fail.
