# Introduction

Welcome to the Verify Payments API ðŸ‘‹! The reference documentation below describes the various functions that you can use to initiate, track and manage fiat transfer using the Verify Payments API.

<aside class="notice">
This API is currently in beta. We may push breaking changes to the API endpoints on short notice. Make sure to <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.verify.as/forum/#!forum/api-announcements" target="_blank" data-link="_">join our mailing list</a> to get notified of such changes ahead of time.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.stgverifypayments.com/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token %test_secret_key%"
```

> The code above actually works. You can paste it directly in your terminal to try it out!

You can authenticate requests to the Verify Payments API by including your public key or secret key in the request that you send, depending on the endpoint. Each endpoint will indicate which key it expects from you. We currently use [Token authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) without the underlying OAuth 2.0 protocol.

<aside class=notice>
<strong>Heads up</strong> &mdash; Never use your <strong>secret key</strong> in any public environments including client-side web apps or mobile applications. It should only be used in direct server-to-server calls.
</aside>

The private keys used to authenticate with the API are generated through the Dashboard &mdash; keep these private! Make sure not to commit them to your source code repositories or share them.

Include the API key for all requests to the server in a header that looks like the following: `Authorization: Token "%test_secret_key%"`

All API calls must be made using [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over unsecured HTTP connections will fail.

# Verifications

Creating a [Session](#sessions) or [Transfer](#transfers) can sometimes require additional verification by our banking providers. There are currently 2 supported methods for verification:

Verification Type | Description
--------- | -----------
`sms` | An SMS code is sent to the registered mobile device and the account owner is requested to provide the numeric code
`questions` | The banking provider returns question(s) and the account owner is requested to supply the answers to these questions

The specific verification method required will depend on several things including the bank that a transfer is initiated from and whether a transfer has previously been completed from this customers' account.

## The verification object

```json
{
  "id": "vrf_zGf5ZH3LzXDz",
  "object": "verification",
  "type": "sms",
  "status": "initial",
  "verifiable_id": "ses_2Ocvnws4y3Yr",
  "verifiable_type": "session",
  "attempt_count": 0,
  "challenge_text": "Please, enter test OTP (1234 to finish or 12345 for one more verification)"
}
```

### Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
id | The unique ID of this verification
object | The type of the object (always `verification` for Verifications)
type | The method of verification required (either `sms` or `questions`)
status | The status of the verification. Can be either `initial`, `retry`, `succeeded` or `failed`
challenge_text | A human-friendly text that can be displayed to the account owner in your custom UI
verifiable_type | The Type of the object that this verification is for. Can either be `transfer` or `session`
verifiable_id | The ID of the [Transfer](#the-transfer-object) or [Session](#the-session-object) to which this verification belongs
attempt_count | The number of times this verification has been attempted

## Submit a verification

> Example Request:

```shell
curl "https://api.stgverifypayments.com/sessions/<id>/verifications/<id>" \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Token %test_public_key%" \
  -d "challenge_response=12345"
```

Submit the `challenge_response` or `answers[]` for a verification. This request is idempotent, and you can safely submit the request multiple times.
